The DriverPass project was about creating a system to help students prepare for their driving test. The client wanted a platform where students could schedule driving lessons, take online practice exams, and track their progress. It also needed features for instructors to manage lessons and for administrators to oversee the system. My job was to take these requirements and design a system that would make the entire process smoother for everyone involved.

One thing I did well was organizing and documenting the system’s requirements clearly. The Business Requirements Document helped lay out what the system needed to do, while the System Design Document turned those needs into a detailed plan with UML diagrams and technical details. These documents provided a strong foundation for building the system.

If I could go back and improve one part of my work, I would refine some of the UML diagrams to make them even clearer and more detailed. For example, in the class diagram, I would improve the relationships between different components and add more descriptions to make it easier to understand how everything connects.

One of the most important things I focused on was understanding the user’s needs. The system had to be easy to use so that students could quickly schedule lessons and access study materials, while instructors needed a simple way to track student progress. If a system isn’t built with the user in mind, it can become frustrating to use, which is why a smooth and intuitive experience is key to a successful design.

When designing software, I like to break things down step by step, starting with user needs, then mapping out features, and finally creating diagrams to visualize how everything fits together. In the future, I plan to use more user feedback and iterative design to refine my systems even further. By staying organized and flexible, I can ensure that the final product is both functional and user-friendly.
